## What is this tool about?

Instead of giving you error messages that force you to keep on looking around for solutions, the tool analysis both your local AND remote configuration and proposes solutions relevant to YOUR configuration. All of this is done within the same user interface, in an application that works on every single platform. This gives you some unique powers like automatically configuring your development machine, and retrieving code from remote repos, building it, and deploying it all from a single place!


## Features implemented so far:
* Multiple AWS authentication methods
* Docker image build from a local Dockerfile and a remote Git repo
* Upload Docker images to ECR
* EC2 instances management management
* Remote deployment and health-check of images
* EKS pods management management and log viewing
* Basic automated troubleshooting infrastructure

## Feature requests
Just ask for ANY feature in the GitHub repo and it will be scheduled for a future release.

## How do I use it
I'm a senior developer and in my day-to-day task I use many tools like k9s, kubectl, AWS dashboard, Confluent dashboard, etc...
I always find that some of the features are missing and I keep on adding them instead of waiting for a tool to implement the feature.
The main advantage of this tool is that I can run it on my mobile phone, and it is already integrated into multiple platforms services like AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, and OKTA.
